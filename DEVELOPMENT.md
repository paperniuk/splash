# Development

Use Apple Silicon with macOS 26.4+, Xcode 26 or newer, Python 3.12–3.14,
and a Metal 4 compiler with `uint4b_format` tensor support.
The macOS 26.2 SDK can compile the host code, but Xcode 26.2's default Metal
component cannot compile the kernels; select a newer Metal toolchain when
using that SDK. Packaged users need none of these development tools.

## Build and run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/incoai/splash.git
cd splash
make -j4
./splash serve --model incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash
```

`--model` requires a full Hugging Face `owner/repo` containing a Splash package.
The first serve sets up Python dependencies, resolves a repository commit and
verifies its manifest and artifacts. Later launches reuse the installed snapshot
offline. Public packages need no login; private/gated packages need `HF_TOKEN`
or `hf auth login`. Ctrl+C stops serving; stop before upgrading.

Use `--max-context 100K` or `--max-memory 28G` to set optional limits. Memory
limits cap Metal allocations, not combined process RSS. Agents must already be
installed; `./splash claude|opencode|codex|hermes` connects to the running server.
Arguments pass through, for example `./splash codex resume --last`.

Set `SPLASH_API_KEY` in the server and agent shells to require authentication;
`serve --api-key KEY` overrides the server's environment value. API requests
then require `Authorization: Bearer KEY` (or Anthropic's `x-api-key`). Health
and readiness probes and the chat page remain public; enter the key in the
chat page to send requests. The page does not persist the key. Use
`serve --no-webui` to disable the page. Authentication is off by default.

HTTP request bodies are limited to 128 MiB; `serve --max-request-size 256M`
overrides this. Concurrent input bytes share a budget of at least 512 MiB
(or twice the request limit), including retained generation inputs. This is
an input-byte budget, not a process RSS limit: large ASCII/base64 strings can
use roughly twice their encoded size during JSON parsing alone. Decoded images
and object-heavy JSON need additional memory. Oversized requests return 413;
exhausted ingress capacity returns 503. Image and model context limits apply
independently.
Stored Responses history is charged before decoding. Uploads allow 30 seconds
of inactivity; total upload time is limited to 30 seconds plus the body size
at 512 KiB/s (286 seconds for 128 MiB), capped by the overall request deadline.
Timed-out uploads return 408 and release their input reservation.
`/status` reports `http.request_body_bytes` and `http.max_request_bytes`.

Source `install/completions/splash.bash` for Bash or
`install/completions/_splash` for Zsh after `compinit`. Completion suggests
commands, bundled official model IDs and installed models without network access.

## Server configuration

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:8000`. To accept LAN connections:

```sh
splash serve --model incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

Connect to the server's LAN IP. `--host` selects the IPv4 bind address;
`--allowed-host NAME` accepts an additional HTTP Host name, such as a custom DNS
name or proxy hostname. It does not change the listener or allowlist client IPs.

Use `--port 8001` or set `SPLASH_PORT=8001` to select another port. Set the same
`SPLASH_PORT` in the local agent shell. Separate ports allow separate servers;
their memory limits are independent. The packaged agent launchers connect to
loopback, so use a listener that includes loopback when launching agents locally.

## API model aliases

Repeat `--served-model-name NAME` to accept additional API model IDs. The full
`--model OWNER/REPO` still selects the package. `/v1/models` lists that ID first,
followed by unique aliases; each alias's `root` identifies the loaded package.
Generation and scoring responses always report the real package ID, even when
requested through an alias. The model list and lookup support both names.

```sh
splash serve --model incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash --served-model-name local-qwen
```

Aliases cannot contain whitespace, control characters, `\`, `%`, `?`, `#`,
or empty, `.` or `..` path segments. This keeps model discovery URLs unambiguous.

## Default reasoning effort

`--default-reasoning-effort` (or `SPLASH_DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT`) sets the
fallback for Chat `reasoning_effort` and Responses `reasoning.effort` when absent
or null. Accepted values: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`,
`max`. An explicit request value wins; the CLI flag takes precedence over the
environment. Unset, the model's template default is unchanged. Effort names are
passed to the template using the same mapping as per-request values, not token
budgets.

```sh
splash serve --model incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash --default-reasoning-effort none
```

`/apply-template` uses the same default. Anthropic `thinking` keeps its protocol
semantics (off when omitted); judgment endpoints always disable thinking.

## Model cache

To download new models to another disk, set the cache location before serving:

```sh
HF_HUB_CACHE=/Volumes/Models/huggingface splash serve --model incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash
```

`HF_HUB_CACHE` selects the Hugging Face download cache. Alternatively, set
`HF_HOME` to relocate the Hugging Face home directory, including its default
`hub` cache. Model links and agent sessions stay in Splash's data directory;
existing downloads are not moved.

## Model packages

Packages contain `manifest.json`, packed `target/`, `draft/`, `vision/` weights
and `tokenizer/`. The manifest lists artifact paths, sizes and SHA-256 hashes.
Dense packages use schema 3 / `splash-packed-q4`; MoE uses schema 4 /
`splash-packed-q4-moe`.

These formats encode Qwen3.8-27B and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B layouts. Compatible community
fine-tunes may use any nonempty manifest model name. Native loading validates
geometry, tensor sizes, binary headers, tokenizer and target/draft compatibility.
New architectures require engine support; ordinary HF weights need conversion.

## Code and API boundaries

- `server/`: OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic Messages/count_tokens, typed
  judgments, templates, streaming and input processing. No client-version branches.
- `runtime/engine/`: scheduling, memory admission and reusable request state.
- `runtime/model/`: target/draft execution and vision.
- `runtime/ops/` and `runtime/metal/`: operators and Metal kernels.
- `install/`: launcher, client configuration and model installation.
- `dev/`: maintained tests, benchmarks and build/release tools.

Within `server/`, `server.py` owns HTTP and startup; `frontend.py` prepares
requests and history; `backend.py` owns native request lifecycles. `judgments.py`
owns finite-choice prompts, validation and typed answer math. `output.py` parses
generated text for both streaming and complete responses, and `constraints.py`
compiles token constraints. `make architecture-check` prevents lower layers from
importing the HTTP entry module.

Tools can be combined with structured answers. Tool argument framing resolves
local references and projects object fields through schema composition. The
original schema validates complete arguments, including cross-field conditions,
dependencies and property-count rules that framing alone cannot enforce. Extra
properties use JSON-encoded values; statically typed strings retain raw text.
Remote schema references and parameter names containing XML delimiters are
unsupported. Hosted search is unsupported; configure client-owned tools such as
MCP. Omitted effort uses the model default.
Hidden thinking signatures use a persistent user key; imported encrypted thinking
preserves visible history without recovering the private reasoning.

`/status.admission` distinguishes memory and concurrency waits, reports suspended
requests, recovery draining and the oldest current wait age. Memory transitions
also appear in the console. Warning pressure can pause growth while `/ready`
remains healthy for work that fits existing allocations.

PDF input supports base64 documents within a shared 64 MiB source/rendering
budget and the native 64-image limit (one image per page). Model context and
isolated rendering limits also apply. URL inputs, opening passwords and citations
are unsupported.
Responses automatic truncation and unsupported history edits return errors.

`POST /tokenize` accepts `{"content":"hello","add_special":false}` and returns
`{"tokens":[...]}` using the loaded tokenizer. Special-token strings are recognized;
`parse_special:false` and `with_pieces:true` are unsupported.
`POST /apply-template` accepts Chat-style `messages`, `tools` and reasoning options,
and returns `{"prompt":"..."}` using the same template as generation.
`add_generation_prompt` defaults to true. Image prompts retain textual placeholders;
raw tokenization does not account for image embeddings (use `count_tokens` for that).
Both endpoints run without inference and share bounded preparation capacity with
`count_tokens`; they can inspect prompts larger than the serving context limit.

Streaming requests accept `"return_progress":true` (default false). Before output,
`prompt_progress` reports `{total, cache, processed, time_ms}`: prompt tokens,
initial cached tokens, completed tokens including cache, and elapsed milliseconds
since prefill admission. Updates follow completed chunks and never regress during
recovery; they are not a time estimate. Chat uses empty-delta chunks, Responses
uses `response.in_progress`, and Messages uses `ping`. Queueing and prompt
preparation do not advance this counter. Non-streaming requests cannot enable it.

`GET /status` returns instance identity and the effective context limit as JSON.
Proxy consumers can use these fields; additional fields may be added:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.submitted`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed` | Native request counters since engine start |
| `memory_actual.current_bytes`, `peak_bytes` | Metal allocations, not process RSS |
| `metrics.decode_tokens_per_second` | Aggregate native decode throughput, not a request's end-to-end rate |
| `maximum_context_tokens` | Declared context limit; available memory may limit admission |

`GET /metrics` exposes the same counters in Prometheus text format. Both endpoints
require the API key when authentication is enabled. Consumers should tolerate
missing native fields while the engine is unavailable, and counter resets after
an engine restart. Chat streams include token usage when the request sets
`"stream_options":{"include_usage":true}`; non-streaming Chat responses always
include usage. A proxy must consume these fields to display statistics.

`/metrics` also exports fixed latency histograms in seconds, with a bounded
set of stages in `/status.latency`. HTTP duration includes body upload and
response writing for admitted API requests. Preparation, queue, template,
tokenization, output grammar preparation and image preparation are measured
separately; preparation includes its nested stages. Tokenization covers the encoding call, including reuse when
available. Histogram buckets are cumulative and labeled by upper bound.
TTFT starts before upload and ends at the first native token
event. Output intervals are between native token events, which can contain
multiple speculative tokens; they are not per-token latency. Native queue timing
is recorded from successful completions. These histograms live with the HTTP
process and survive a native engine restart.

HTTP bodies require Content-Length, and browser
Origin must match Host. `--allowed-host` permits additional hostnames. Request
logs omit bodies; full crash traces require explicit `SPLASH_CRASH_TRACE=1` and
can contain private conversation data.

Requests sharing a cold prefix can wait for a resident request's planned recovery
point, then enter through the ordinary cache restore path. Waiting requests hold
no active state cell or KV pages and return to ordinary admission when no useful
producer remains. Late arrivals can extend the plan at complete state boundaries.
Higher-priority work does not wait for a lower-priority producer. `/status` exposes
`scheduler.waiting_prefix` separately from resource waits.

Greedy and sampled requests can share an unconstrained decode batch; each lane
keeps its own sampling policy and RNG. Pure greedy batches retain their argmax
path. Constrained requests use a separate batch for the host mask exchange.

Long prefill uses disposable rolling checkpoints every 4096 tokens. Contended
prefill adapts toward a 500 ms slice, keeping 2048-token chunks for long unopposed
work. These policies do not extend client deadlines. Memory recovery waits are
bounded, but readiness does not guarantee that a request-sized allocation fits.

### Judgment contracts

`POST /v1/systemone` accepts the [TypeSafe System One](https://docs.typesafe.ai/)
request and response shapes: `noul`, `choice` and `score` questions over a shared
state. It works with the official `typesafe-sdk` (verified with 0.7.0). Use the
actual served model ID, not a hosted Jev model name; `/v1/models` answers both
OpenAI model discovery and the SDK's `models.list()`.

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000",
    api_key="local",  # Use SPLASH_API_KEY's value if server authentication is on.
    model="incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash",
) as client:
    result = client.system_one(
        state={"message": "I was charged twice. Please fix this today."},
        questions={
            "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?"),
            "department": Choice(
                instructions="Which team should handle this?",
                criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None, "sales": None},
            ),
            "urgency": Score(
                instructions="How urgent is the request?",
                criteria=["No urgency", "This week", "Today"],
            ),
        },
    )
    print(result.choices["department"].choice)
```

`POST /v1/judgments` scores one [SemIf](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf) row of
2–16 options and returns raw option logits:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/judgments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "approval",
    "state": "The proposal is awaiting approval.",
    "question": "What is the current approval status?",
    "options": [
      {"id": "approved", "description": "Approval was explicitly given."},
      {"id": "pending", "description": "Approval has not been given."}
    ]
  }'
```

`POST /v1/judgments` preserves SemIf's `direct-options-v1` JSON serialization,
system prompt and A–P option order. It returns the exact rendered prompt's SHA-256,
answer token IDs, raw option logits, normalized probabilities and zero completion
tokens. Every answer label must round-trip as one token, including at the actual
assistant prompt boundary. Unsupported generation controls return errors rather
than silently changing the scoring protocol. SemIf-derived code retains its MIT
notice in `server/judgments.py`.

`POST /v1/systemone` requires the served `model`, a string/object/array `state`,
and a nonempty `questions` map. Instructions may be omitted, null or structured;
criteria descriptions may also be structured. Noul criteria may be omitted.
Choice and score domains contain 1–255 entries. Singletons return their sole
answer without inference. Other domains use deterministic, distinct single-token
slots selected from the tokenizer. All questions are validated before any inference.
A request holds at most 64 questions and 1M total prepared prompt tokens;
larger batches are rejected before any inference.
Questions run sequentially within a request under one shared deadline, allowing
prefix reuse without filling the admission queue; independent HTTP requests still
share the scheduler. Disconnects and timeouts cancel the current question.

Preparation renders each prompt once, then enforces the context limit and the
batch token budget before the per-slot boundary checks, which re-tokenize the
prompt once per option. Those checks also observe the request deadline, so an
oversized or expired request is rejected without paying for every option.
Prompts that exceed the context limit are rejected, not truncated.

System One validation uses 422 `detail` arrays; successful responses contain
`model`, `answers`, and `usage`, plus an `x-typesafe-request-id` header. SDK model
discovery reports an empty `release_date` because packages do not record one.
The official SDK is a client only, not a server dependency. API compatibility does
not imply Jev weights, accuracy, proprietary confidence semantics or calibration.

These are local model scores, not calibrated confidence. Probabilities are a
softmax over the declared answer slots. Choice/score `confidence` is normalized
entropy concentration, `1 - H(p) / log(K)`, not an estimate of correctness.
Score answers are probability-weighted level indices. Measure accuracy and
calibrate on representative held-out data before using decision thresholds.

Native wire version 6 appends score-token IDs to requests and selected f32 logits
to Done events; a version mismatch is fatal. Scoring requires 2–255 distinct,
in-vocabulary tokens, no images or generation constraints, and a zero output budget.
It may use the full context window because no generated token needs a reserved
position. The final prefill chunk runs the target head but no sampling policy or
DFlash decode. Successful scoring emits no Tokens event, finishes with Stop, and
reports zero decode time. Cancelled requests carry no logits.

A non-finite score logit is a per-request failure, not an engine fault: the
engine reports `model_result_invalid` for that request alone, before it
publishes the failing step's cache state or any output, and the rest of the
batch finishes normally. Prompt chunks that already succeeded keep the blocks
they committed, exactly as they do for a cancelled request. GPU faults and
broken engine invariants stay fatal and still mark the runtime unhealthy.

## Validate

```sh
make check
make install test-real test-http-real MODEL=incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash
```

`make check-native-cpu` builds production and runs native CPU tests without a
GPU. `make check-native-metal` requires a supported Metal device; `make check`
includes both. Hosted CI runs CPU checks and sanitizers; the hardware release
gate runs the full suite.

Repeat model tests with `MODEL=incoai/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Splash`.
Before release, install all four agents and run `make release-check MODEL=...`
for both models from a clean checkout. It includes correctness, sanitizers,
real HTTP/client behavior and performance checks.

Compare performance on the same idle Mac with the same model and workload.
`make tune-kernels MODEL=...` measures kernel policies. Keep generated reports,
profiles, local paths and experiment notes out of the source tree and commits.

### Local benchmarks

From a source checkout with the model installed, use the existing native
benchmark for prefill, decode and batch measurements:

```sh
make test-performance-real MODEL=incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash
```

It writes `build/release/backend-benchmark.json`. Repeat with the 35B package
for that model. This characterizes one build; it is not a comparison with
another engine or a test of agent task quality.

For a same-machine HTTP regression check, retain the previous `splash` binary
**and its adjacent `splash.metallib`**, then run from the candidate checkout:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m dev.benchmarks.http_regression \
  --model incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash \
  --baseline-binary /path/to/baseline/build/splash \
  --contexts 2048,10000 --samples 5
```

This starts isolated servers in alternating order, compares matched cold,
exact-prefix and decode requests, and saves `build/release/http-regression.json`.
It does not contact your running server. Use the same power mode and charger,
stop other GPU workloads, and report chip/GPU cores, memory, Splash version,
model revision, actual input/output token counts, and cache hits with results.
Keep cold prefill, cached TTFT and sustained decode separate; a UI token rate
alone does not measure end-to-end agent performance.

For slow tool-bearing requests, the `latency` section of `/status` separates
preparation, tokenization, grammar preparation, native queueing and TTFT. Grammar preparation
includes construction, compilation/cache lookup and per-request cloning;
it does not include generation-time masks. The `grammar_cache` counters show
whether compiled output grammars are reused. Tool definitions still contribute
tokens to the prompt; saving their JSON alone cannot avoid model prefill.
Existing exact-prefix caching reuses model work while the server remains alive.
Text requests also reuse tokenized history at literal message-end boundaries
when the tokenizer supports independent encoding there. This process-local
cache retains at most four prefixes and 8 MiB of text/token storage; it falls
back to full encoding for other tokenizer pipelines. `/status.tokenizer_cache`
reports its usage. It does not alter prompt text, token IDs or the GPU KV cache.
Server restarts require recomputation. The separate
[SSD cache proposal](https://github.com/incoai/splash/pull/3) preserves evicted
model state during a server session; its temporary files do not survive shutdown.

## Package

Release archives contain no Hugging Face credentials and use the official model
list committed with the source. The model-catalog workflow updates that list
from the official collection independently of packaging.
Users accessing private models supply their own `HF_TOKEN` or Hugging Face login.

Release versions are three-part, `x.y.z`, with no `v` prefix: `1.0.0`, then
`1.0.1` for a fix and `1.1.0` for a feature. Use the same version in all three
commands:

```sh
make package RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-bottle RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-check RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
```

The archive, checksum, formula and bottle go to `dist/`; these commands do not
publish. Build bottles on the oldest supported macOS. Bottle/check commands use
a temporary tap and remove their installation; they refuse to replace an existing
Splash installation. The install check requires a poured bottle and runs the
bundled launcher without a compiler or separate Python installation.

To publish: create a GitHub Release on the public mirror `incoai/splash` with
the archive, bottle, checksum files and `SHA256SUMS`, then copy `dist/splash.rb`
over `Formula/splash.rb` in `incoai/homebrew-tap`. Both public repositories
hold exactly one squashed commit of this repository's `main`, authored by Jian
Chen with Zhijian Liu as co-author, and are updated by force-push, never by
pull request. Before re-squashing, `main` must contain no references to the internal
or academic mirrors of the model repositories. Then, on a clean machine:
`brew install incoai/tap/splash && splash --help`, and
`brew audit --strict --online incoai/tap/splash`.

The runtime package allowlists engine, Python, server and launcher files; tests,
benchmarks and developer documents are excluded. User model links and Hermes
sessions survive upgrades; downloads remain in the Hugging Face cache.
